				<h1>Medicine (Researcher Role Ability)</h1>
				<p>Researchers keep people alive who should be dead with their knowledge and training. In the vastness of the Origin system, they are as much mechanics as they are doctors, caring for people who are oftentimes more machine than human. The Researcher Role Ability is Medicine. <b>Whenever the Researcher increases their Medicine Rank, they also choose one of the following three Medicine Specialties (Surgery, Biotech [Pharmaceuticals], or Biotech [Cryopod Operation]) to allocate 1 point to.</b></p>
				<p>The Medical Section contains additional uses for both the Surgery and Biotech Skills, which are only available to Researchers through this Role Ability (See pg. 226). These include Modification installation and harvesting, Bodysculpting, and Therapy!</p>

				<h3><span class="rarrow">▶</span> Surgery</h2>
				<p>For every point you allocate to Surgery, you gain 2 points in the Surgery Skill (up to a maximum of 10). The Surgery Skill is the TECH Skill used to treat the most severe Critical Injuries, as well as implant modifications, and is only available to Researchers through this Medicine Specialty.</p>
			</td>
			<td style="text-align:left" width=33%>
				<h3><span class="rarrow">▶</span> Biotech (Pharmaceuticals)</h2>
				<p>For every point you allocate to Biotech (Pharmaceuticals), you gain 1 point in the Biotech Skill (up to a maximum of 10). The Biotech Skill is the TECH Skill used to operate, understand, and repair (as other non-vehicle Tech Skills) medical machinery. This Skill is only available to Researchers, and only through either this Medicine Specialty or Cryopod Operation. You can only put a maximum of 5 points into this specialty.</p>
				<p>Each time you allocate a point into Pharmaceuticals you also gain access to one of the following pharmaceuticals, which your Character can synthesize by rolling a DV13 Biotech Check, wasting the materials used on a failure. A Researcher can make a number of doses from 200eb of materials equal to their Biotech Skill in 1 hour. You can't synthesize Street Drugs with Biotech (Pharmaceuticals).</p>

					Applying a single dose of a drug to a target takes an Action. If the target is unwilling, the Medtech can use their Action to attempt to make a single Melee Weapon Attack with their Airhypo against the target, that administers a single dose to their target on a hit instead of dealing damage.
				</p>
				<p>
					A Character who is not a Medtech cannot administer Pharmaceuticals correctly. These aren't Street Drugs, they require training to get the medically correct proportions.
