				<p><b>Starting at Rank 3,</b> Profit gives the Corpus a Crewman. <b>Ranks 5 and 9</b> of Profit give the Corpus an additional Crewman, capping out at <b>a maximum of 3 total Crewmen at Rank 9.</b></p>
				<p>Crewmen are rolled from a special chart for each of their jobs. The Corpus chooses which class of Crewmen they want, but their roll on the chart determines the STATs of the Crewman The Board hires for them.</p>
				<p>While constructed like Player Characters, they vary in several distinct ways.</p>
				<p>• They do not improve their Skills. They determine and heal their HP like Player Characters do.</p>
				<p>• They are controlled by the GM, and their ability to follow an order depends on their Loyalty and ability to make a Loyalty Check.</p>
				<p>• <b>They cannot wear Armor other than Light Armorjack.</b> Corpus Policy.</p>
				<p><b>Losing Crewmen:</b> If a Crewman is lost, The Board will repossess their equipment and replace them during the next game session. This "new hire" has new STATs, but their starting Loyalty is reduced to 1 (they heard about what happened). <b>In addition, this will cost the Corpus an additional <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/warframe/images/b/b1/Credits64.png" height=15/>20.000 credits in "hiring fees" (bribes) to The Board.</b></p>
				<p><b><i>What, you thought The Board just hired assassins for you?</i></b></p>
				<p><b>Loyalty:</b> While Crewmen work for the Corpus, they are not mindless drones. They do the tasks given to them by the Corpus based on their Loyalty to their boss (or the paycheck they sign for them). Loyalty is a shifting value; a Corpus must (during every game session) do things to promote Loyalty and not lose it. <b>Loyalty caps at maximum of 10 between game sessions, but during an individual game session, Loyalty has no limit.</b></p>
				<p><b>Loyalty Save:</b> When a task is given to a Crewman by the Corpus, the GM must roll 1d6 under the Crewman's current Loyalty. If the Save is failed, the Crewman may refuse or botch the assignment or otherwise turn on the Corpus. If Loyalty drops to 0 or lower, the Crewman will actively attempt to betray the Corpus to their enemies. If at the end of a session a Crewman has less than 0 Loyalty, they will complain to The Board of Directors and either receive a transfer or quit upon having one refused, depending on The Board's whims. Either way, they are gone. See Losing Crewmen, just above.</p>
