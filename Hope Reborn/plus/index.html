				<h1 id="Biographies">NPC Biographies</h1>
				<p>
					The following section provides short biographies for every named NPC in <b><i>Tales of the RED: Hope Reborn</i></b>, listed alphabetically by first name or Handle. Each entry lists their Roles, if they have any, and provides three personality/quirk keywords to help GMs roleplay them effectively. These residents of Night City exist outside the Missions they appear in, so feel free to use them as background NPCs in other Missions or link them to an Edgerunner’s Lifepath.
				</p>
				<h2><span class="rarrow">▶</span> Anver “Anvil” Carson</h2>
				<p><b>Solo</b> <i>(Professional • Loyal • Canadian Accent)</i></p>
				<p>A former Canadian Marine, Anvil lives by a code. He does his job, he does it well, and he does it with loyalty. His job, in this case, is as a bodyguard for Juliana “Jules” Lung. Professionally, he’s top notch. Personally, he’s a bit of a mess. Instead of dealing with the trauma he’s seen as a Solo, Anvil prefers to drown his sorrows in alcohol and braindances. <i>Appears in The Devil’s Cut.</i></p>
				<h2><span class="rarrow">▶</span> Aurora “Rory” O’Reilly</h2>
				<p><b>Media</b> <i>(Earnest • Raw • Sarcastic)</i></p>
				<p>As she discovered recently, Rory is the daughter of deceased journalist C.J. O’Reilly and former Federal Marshall Gayle “Nails” Sigmund. During the 4th Corporate War, her mother gave her up to a group home for protection. When the war ended, Nails returned to the group home, only to find it destroyed. The children had been evacuated but no one knew to where. Rory grew up as Aurora Smith, not knowing where she came from. When she reached adulthood, she branched out into livecasting her life, trying to cover the news of Night City as a gonzo journalist through the Boomtown Garden Patch network.</p>
				<p>Her ‘casts caught the attention of the crew at The Forlorn Hope, who spotted the resemblance between the Rory and her parents. They brought her home just in time to meet Nails, who died soon moments later. Rory took her dad’s last name, in part to honor where she came from and in part to trade on his reputation as a Media. She’s now a regular at The Forlorn Hope and a member of the Willows. <i>Appears in A Tale of Hope and The Angel’s Share. Mentioned in Hope’s Calling!!!</i></p>
				<h2><span class="rarrow">▶</span> Axel “Axeman” Mankievicz</h2>
				<p><b>Solo</b> <i>(Hardboiled • Philosophical • Tired)</i></p>
				<p>Back in the day, Axel was a classic private eye. He took the cases the cops wouldn’t touch, either because they didn’t think it was worth their time or because they were paid to look the other way. Following a beating ordered by an Infocomp executive, he began reevaluating his life. The 4th Corporate War pushed him further down the road of self-reflection. In its aftermath, The Professor roped him into locating people lost and forgotten during the war. The work helped him find a new cause, and he functions as The Professor’s agent in the cause of helping veterans find the aid they need to keep going in a world that’s left them behind. <i>Mentioned in Hope’s Calling!!!</i></p>
				<h1 id="Locations">Important Locations</h1>
				<p>
					This section includes a map of Night City with locations important to <b><i>Tales of the RED: Hope Reborn</i></b> pinned, followed by a short description of each. Note The Forlorn Hope itself (pin 6 on the map) is in two locations to reflect where it is at the beginning of <i>The Angel’s Share</i> and where it moves to as of the end of <i>Real Estate Rumble</i>. Also, The Devil’s Cut (9) and Woodland Park (19) are pinned as single locations with multiple sub-locations.
				</p>
				<h1 id="New Gear">New Gear</h1>
				<p>
					We hinted at the following gear in <b><i>Tales of the RED: Hope Reborn</i></b>, but had to cut them from the book.
				</p>
				<h1 id="NPC Tokens">NPC Tokens</h1>
				<p>
					Whether you’re playing at a physical table or a digital one, tokens can help you keep track of the action. To help, we’ve created a set of tokens to use with <b><i>Tales of the RED: Hope Reborn</i></b>.
