				<h1>Reinforcement (Grineer Role Ability)</h1>
				<p>The Grineer's Role Ability is Reinforcement. Grineer can call upon the help of a group of fellow marines, based on the Grineer's Reinforcement Rank and the conditions under which the call is made. The Reinforcement will be armed and armored based on the table below, and will be played by the GM.</p>
				<p>As a Grineer increases in Rank, they are likely to be promoted within their current military force or to be recruited by specialized corps that they can currently call Reinforcements from.</p>
				<p><b>When in danger,</b> you can call on Reinforcements from a group of your Reinforcement Rank or lower. As an Action, you attempt to roll equal or lower than your Reinforcement Rank on a d10 to get someone to respond to your call. <b>If you abuse this, your Captain will throw you off the corps or fine you as they see fit.</b></p>
				<p>After someone responds to your call, you roll a d6 to find out in how many Rounds your reinforcements will arrive on the scene. If you roll a 6 on this roll, instead of your typical reinforcement, the reinforcement that arrives will be of the next highest level of reinforcement, unless you are Rank 10, in which case two separate reinforcement groups will arrive. <b>If nobody responds to your call, you can always try your reinforcement call again next Turn.</b></p>
