				<h1>Charismatic Impact (Prophet Role Ability)</h1>
				<p>The Prophet has the Role ability Charismatic Impact. They can influence others by sheer presence of personality. They need not be a religious figure ; they can influence others through poetry, art, dance, or simply their physical presence. They could be a prophet—or a musical performer.</p>

				<p>Assuming you aren't in combat, you can make people who aren't currently followers into followers (unless they actively dislike you) by rolling Charismatic Impact + 1d10 vs. a DV8 for a Single Person, DV10 for a Small Group of up to 6, or DV12 for a Huge Group.</p>
				<p style="text-align:center"><b style="text-align:center"><i>The GM determines whenever someone you meet is already a Follower.</i></b></p>
				<p>When a Prophet wants to make use of their Charismatic Impact on a follower or group of followers, the GM uses the table below to determine if the favor is something within the powers of their Charismatic Impact given their current Role Ability Rank. If it isn't, the Prophet automatically fails. <b>If it is, the group size determines the DV against which the Prophet must roll Charismatic Impact + 1d10.</b> If they succeed, the follower or group of followers puts their best effort toward the favor the Prophet asked for. If they fail, the Prophet can't ask for the same favor again from those followers for a week.</p>
