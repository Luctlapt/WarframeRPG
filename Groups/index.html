Their logo can be found stamped on equipment such as Crewman helmets, on weapons such as the Dera, is displayed on holographic signs in Fortuna and in Corpus Gas Cities and is printed on many surfaces of facilities in most Corpus Locations. They are represented by a circle within a triangle within a circle.</p>
							<p style="margin: 10px 0px 25px 25px;">Utilizing their <i>Nanocomposite Foundry Forges</i>, whose technology might be related to Tenno Foundries, <i>Luxor</i> produces the vast majority of Corpus technology on a massive scale. As such, it is likely owned by the Corpus Board of Directors as seen by their prevalence and iconography present alongside Alad V and Nef Anyo in displays found in Corpus Gas Cities and Fortuna, respectively. Perrin Sequence crewmembers may be referencing Luxor foundry forges when they talk about "machines that can make other machines."</p>

Their logo is represented as a 5-pointed star and can be seen on Corpus Control Consoles and on Corpus Datamass.

							<p>Parvos Granum is the original founder of the Orokin-era Corpus merchant cult and the inventor of Specter technology. As part of a deal he made with the Orokin, he received the ProteaIcon272 Protea Warframe as a bodyguard. He was presumed dead for millennia after being betrayed by the Corpus Board of Directors, where an assassination attempt resulted in his ship being lost during a faulty Void translation.</p>
							<p>Unlike the current-era Corpus, most notably Nef Anyo, who have achieved their wealth through slothful means, Parvos Granum is a cold, calculating, and intelligent individual who values hard work and will actively take steps and measures to achieve his goals. Disappointed in how low the Corpus have fallen on his return from the Void, Parvos proclaims he will restructure the Corpus or will otherwise separate himself from them to form a splinter faction. Following his return, the current Corpus Board of Directors have been largely absent as Parvos leads Corpus forces in space, formed the Sisters of Parvos with Vala Glarios as his assistant, has dispatched salvage teams to the Zariman Ten Zero, and hired Drusus to acquire Entrati artifacts from Albrecht's Laboratories.</p>
