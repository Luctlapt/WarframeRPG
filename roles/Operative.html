				<h1>Syndicate Alert (Operative Role Ability)</h1>
				<p>When combat begins (before Initiative is rolled), anytime outside of combat, or in combat with an Action, an Operative may divide the total number of points they have in their Syndicate Alert Role Ability among the following abilities. If an Operative chooses to not change their point assignments, their previous ones persist. Activating some of these abilities will cost the Operative more points than others:</p>

				<h3><span class="rarrow">▶</span> Damage Deflection</h3>
				<p>You have been trained to "roll with the punches," reducing damage done to you.</p>

				<p>You have been trained to instantly recover from mishaps by taking your time with every shot. For 4 points, you ignore critical failures (1s) you roll while attacking. These rolls are still treated as 1, however.</p>
